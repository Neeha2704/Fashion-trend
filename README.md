# Gen Fashion
To create a comprehensive social shopping integration platform that seamlessly combines social interactions with e-commerce functionalities, enhancing the overall shopping experience through real-time recommendations, personalized content, and community engagement.
We have created a prototype by using Figma app.Our Team idea is to Implement Gamification  and Rewards.
We have Introduced gamification elements such as shopping challenges, loyalty programs, and reward points to enhance user engagement and encourage repeat purchases.
Offer exclusive discounts, early access to sales, and special promotions for active users and community participants.
We have also Introduced Social sharing. Sharing Game links to earn points from your family and friends.
